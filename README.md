# rpi-dashboard
This project is essentially just a fairly simple Bash script. The goal is to work up from the bare OS (I'll be using the 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite) and turn a Pi Zero 2 W into a functioning desktop and a dashboard. Naturally, if this works with the Pi Zero series, it should work with the main line of Pi devices.
